### defineConfig 
to render pages in the server, instead all static pages. 
- We have to defineConfig output in the server for this project. Because the app use a lot of albuns and songs in every page, it make sense to use a server. 

###Transitions 
- the Player.jsx is set to transition:persist, we want that the currentSong persists if we change pages


### Global State with Zustant
- install zustant for a global state for the currentSong
